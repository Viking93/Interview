Content Delivery Network(CDN) is a group of distrbuted servers which provide fast delivery of internet content.

Benefits
********

1. Improved Website load time - It does caching of static content at the network edge which enables user to
access content from a nearby cdn server.
2. Reduced bandwidth costs 
3. Increased content availability and redundancy 
3. Improved website security - Provides network and application level protection preventing harm or loss of service by
filtering traffic with web application firewalls and DDoS protection services integrated at the edge locations and 
integrated into the caching network.
4. Deliver dynamic content - They deliver dynamic content by maintaining a secure open connection to the origin server(same
network in the case of cloud based cdn) which accelerates routing back to origin server for dynamic content.
5. Perform logic computation at the edge - It can quickly inspect the requests, modify caching logic, do authentication and
can even modify the content while delivery and ingestion.

Working
*******

CDN works by placing servers at IXPs(internet exchange points) between different networks. IXPs are the primary locations where
different Internet providers connect in order to provide each other access to traffic originating on their different networks.
